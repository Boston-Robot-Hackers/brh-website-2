# CNC Mill Now Online!

We're excited to announce that our new **3-axis CNC mill** is fully installed and operational! This precision machine opens up incredible possibilities for our robotics projects.

## What You Can Make

- Custom aluminum brackets and chassis components
- Precision gear systems
- PCB enclosures with tight tolerances
- Prototype mechanical parts

## Getting Started

To use the CNC mill, you'll need to complete our safety certification:

```python
# Example G-code for a simple square cut
def generate_square_gcode(size=10):
    gcode = [
        "G21",  # Set units to millimeters
        "G90",  # Absolute positioning
        f"G1 X0 Y0 F1000",  # Move to origin
        f"G1 X{size} Y0",   # First side
        f"G1 X{size} Y{size}",  # Second side
        f"G1 X0 Y{size}",   # Third side
        f"G1 X0 Y0",        # Return to origin
    ]
    return "\n".join(gcode)
```

## Safety Training Schedule

- **August 5th, 7PM**: Introduction to CNC operation
- **August 8th, 7PM**: Hands-on workshop
