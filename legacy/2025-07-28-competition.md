# Competition Winners Announced!

What an incredible showing at our Summer Robot Competition! We had 12 teams competing in the autonomous navigation challenge.

## The Challenge

Teams had to build robots that could:
- Navigate a maze autonomously
- Avoid dynamic obstacles
- Reach the goal in under 3 minutes

## Winning Solutions

### ðŸ¥‡ First Place: Team Bolt
**LIDAR + SLAM Implementation**

```cpp
// Core navigation algorithm
void navigate() {
    updateLidarScan();
    buildOccupancyGrid();
    
    if (pathBlocked()) {
        replanPath();
    }
    
    moveTowardGoal();
}
```

Team Bolt's innovative use of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) with a $150 LIDAR sensor impressed all the judges.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Second Place: Team Phoenix
**Computer Vision + IMU**

Used dual cameras for stereo vision depth perception combined with precise IMU tracking.

### ðŸ¥‰ Third Place: Team Dynamo
**Ultrasonic Sensor Array**

Proved that simple solutions can be highly effective with their 8-sensor ultrasonic setup and clever path-finding algorithm.

## Next Competition

Mark your calendars! Our **Winter Battle Bots** competition is scheduled for December 15th. Start designing those combat robots!
