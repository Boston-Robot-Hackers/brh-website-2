We had about 25 people at the meeting which is pretty good for a first meeting. </p>\n<p>We kicked off with five or so show-and-tell demos. Pito introduced himself and shared some facts about BRH and the current membership. Here's the presentation. And then Buddy E gave a talk all about servos. Here is Buddy's presentation.</p>",
