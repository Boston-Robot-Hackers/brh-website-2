Everyone is encouraged to bring a show and tell artifact, whatever it might be. Either to show off a new project, or progress on an existing project, or to get help solving a problem. A long table is set up just for this purpose.</li>\n<li>7:20 - Each show and teller gives a very brief explanation of what they brought and takes a few questions.</li>\n<li>7:35 - Main talk, which varies every month. We look for speakers where we can all learn something useful and interesting towards our own projects. Most of the talks will be very technical, and some demo is strongly encouraged. Talk to Pito if you have an idea and want to be put on the schedule.</li>\n<li>8:15 - Discuisson and Q&amp;A</li>\n<li>8:30 - Wrap</li>\n</ol>",

We had about 25 people at the meeting which is pretty good for a first meeting. </p>\n<p>We kicked off with five or so show-and-tell demos. Pito introduced himself and shared some facts about BRH and the current membership. Here's the presentation. And then Buddy E gave a talk all about servos. Here is Buddy's presentation.</p>",
