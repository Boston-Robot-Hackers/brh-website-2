# Alex Chen - Community Founder

Former **Boston Dynamics** engineer with 8+ years of experience in autonomous navigation systems. Founded Boston Robot Hackers in 2019 to create an inclusive, collaborative space for robotics innovation in the Boston area.

## Background

Alex holds a Master's in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and has worked on cutting-edge robotic systems including:

- Quadruped locomotion algorithms at Boston Dynamics
- Autonomous vehicle perception systems
- Industrial robot arm control systems

## Current Projects

### Autonomous Delivery Bot
Leading the community's flagship project to build a robot capable of navigating multi-floor buildings and delivering items autonomously.

```cpp
// Example navigation code Alex contributed
class NavigationPlanner {
public:
    bool planPath(const Pose& start, const Pose& goal) {
        // A* pathfinding with dynamic obstacle avoidance
        return astar_planner_.plan(start, goal, obstacles_);
    }
};
```

### Community Leadership
- Organizes monthly robotics competitions
- Mentors new members in ROS development
- Coordinates collaboration with local universities

## Philosophy

> "The best innovations happen when diverse minds collaborate. Our community thrives because we welcome everyone from students to industry veterans."

Alex believes in hands-on learning and has established partnerships with MIT, Harvard, and Northeastern to provide students with real-world robotics experience.
