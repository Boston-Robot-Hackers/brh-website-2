# Autonomous Delivery Bot

**Project Lead:** Sarah Martinez  
**Team Members:** 8 active contributors  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Started:** January 2025

## Overview

Our autonomous delivery bot project aims to create a robot capable of navigating indoor spaces and delivering items between floors using advanced pathfinding algorithms. This is our flagship community project that combines mechanical engineering, computer vision, and AI navigation.

## Current Progress

- ‚úÖ **Chassis Design Complete** - Custom aluminum frame with integrated sensor mounts
- ‚úÖ **Motor Controller Integration** - Successfully implemented with ROS2 navigation stack
- üîÑ **Computer Vision System** - Currently testing SLAM algorithms for real-time mapping
- üîÑ **Safety Systems** - Implementing emergency stop and obstacle avoidance
- ‚è≥ **Fleet Management** - Planning multi-robot coordination system

## Technical Specifications

- **Platform:** ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04
- **Sensors:** LiDAR, RGB-D camera, IMU, wheel encoders
- **Compute:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
- **Payload:** Up to 5kg capacity
- **Navigation:** Nav2 stack with custom local planners

## Key Challenges

1. **Dynamic Environment Handling** - Navigating around people and temporary obstacles
2. **Elevator Integration** - Developing protocols for multi-floor navigation
3. **Battery Management** - Optimizing power consumption for 8-hour operation cycles
4. **User Interface** - Creating intuitive delivery request and tracking system

## Next Milestones

- **March 2025:** Complete alpha testing in controlled environment
- **April 2025:** Begin beta testing with actual delivery scenarios
- **June 2025:** Public demonstration at Boston Robotics Expo

## Get Involved

This project welcomes contributors with experience in:
- ROS2 development
- Computer vision and SLAM
- Mechanical design and 3D printing
- Web development for user interfaces
- System integration and testing

**Weekly meetings:** Thursdays 7pm in the main lab
