I have been a software engineer for almost 50 years. For most of my career I have worked on networking, operating systems or robotics projects. For the last 10 years I have worked on a couple of robotics projects in both industry and academia. I am currently semi-retired though I do some part-time robot firmware development for a local University.

I have been a member of Artisan's Asylum for a few years - where I have taught introductory classes to Python and the Raspberry Pi.
