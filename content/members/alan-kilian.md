I'm a retired software/firmware engineer and manager who has loved and worked with robots for my entire life.

I started my career at Cray Research Inc in 1982 writing hardware diagnostics for the Cray-1. I worked at Cray for 16 years doing TCP/IP kernel work, porting X11 windowing software, writing a graphics rendering package and eventually managing other developers before moving on to other less well-known companies.

I've done some IOT stuff over the year.

I like doing 3D modeling using OnShape and printing using a Prusa MK4S printer.

I founded the Twin Cities Robotics Group and ran it for about 25 years before moving to Cambridge, MA.

I also held a weekly meeting at my house called Kilian's Robot Shop Of Horrors (RSOH) http://www.sampson-jeff.com/rsoh/ where we did projects until the wee hours of the morning. We did this for about 12-15 years although we didn't document for more than a few years.
