# Welcome To Boston Robot Hackers

We are a brand new group of people passionate about robotics. We are hardware and software people, professionals and students, experts and beginners. What we share is that we all want to make connections with like minded folks, learn and share, and build together. The club is Boston based, so that live events either in person or online will focus on the Boston area. Of course members outside of Boston are also welcome (and we have lots from all over the world!) Some of our members have great connections in the robotics industry.
